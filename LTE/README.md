# QMI connection

These files can be used in case you have an LTE module with 4G or 5G. To install the module and establish an internet connection you first need to define what is the APN your service uses. Edit the [qmi_connect.sh](https://github.com/Ubiqu0/Ubiquo/blob/main/LTE/qmi/qmi_connect.sh) file accordingly. 


```
chmod +x install_qmi.sh
sudo ./install_qmi.sh
```
